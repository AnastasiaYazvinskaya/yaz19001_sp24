### Introduction

```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```


### Elevator pitch

_This project helped me understand that it is always worth checking data for correctness. Despite the fact that we cannot always check how correct the data is, nevertheless, it must correspond to the type determined by the meaning of the column. Thus, if a column contains the value of the number of canceled flights, then it cannot be less than 0, and must also be a numeric value. It is important to consider all these nuances before starting to work with data. We can also take into account if the data is lost and has an empty value. Depending on the task, rows with these values may or may not be taken into account._

```{python}
#| label: project-data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
df = pd.read_json("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4missing/master/data-raw/flights_missing/flights_missing.json")
```


### Q1: Standardization of Missing Data Types

__Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”).__
In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value.

_After analyzing all the columns of the table, it was discovered that only the Airport Name and Month columns had missing data. So in the Name of airports there were empty lines as values, and in months n/a was indicated. For correct operation in the future, all these values in these columns have been replaced with the value NaN. The table shows an example of the final data._

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Find missing data and fix it with NaN value
wrongData = df.query('(airport_name == "" or airport_name == "n/a") or (month == "" or month == "n/a")')

wrongData.replace('', np.nan, inplace=True)
wrongData.replace('n/a', np.nan, inplace=True)
# Columns to include in the resut table
columns_to_include = ['airport_name', 'month']
# Filter DataFrame to include only desired columns
wrongData = wrongData[columns_to_include]
```

```{python}
#| label: Q1table
#| code-summary: Example of NaN values
#| tbl-cap: "Example of NaN values in Airport name and Month"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
table1 = wrongData.head(5).tail(2)

display(table1)
```

## Q2: Analysis of Airport Delays

__Which airport has the worst delays?__
Describe the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.

_In my understanding, the worst airport is the one that has the most delayed flights, since this does not give confidence whether my flight will be canceled or not, as well as the longest delay time, because this means that I have to plan too much time, taking into account possible postponement of the flight for subsequent business. According to this definition, a table was compiled in which we can see that the SFO airport is the worst in relation to it, since it most often has delays and in fact has the longest average delay time._

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Calculate average delay time and proportion of delayed flights and group data by airport
# Add the 'average delay time in hours' column
data2 = df.assign(average_delay_time_in_hour = df.minutes_delayed_total/df.num_of_delays_total/60)
# Group rows by the 'airport code'
data2 = data2.groupby("airport_code").agg(
    total_num_of_flights = ('num_of_flights_total', 'sum'),
    total_num_of_delays = ('num_of_delays_total', 'sum'),
    average_delay_time_in_hour = ('average_delay_time_in_hour', 'mean')
)
# Add the 'proportion of delayed flights' column
data2 = data2.assign(proportion_of_delayed_flights = lambda x: x.total_num_of_delays/x.total_num_of_flights)

```

```{python}
#| label: Q2table
#| code-summary: Sort data to find the worst airport
#| tbl-cap: "Rating of airports"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Sort table by the 'average delay time in hours' and 'proportion of delayed flights'
table2 = data2.sort_values(['proportion_of_delayed_flights', 'average_delay_time_in_hour'], ascending=False)
# Print out table
display(table2)
```

## Q3: Optimal Month for Minimizing Flight Delays

__What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length?__
Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)

_In this graph we can see the percentage of delayed flights for each month. So we see that December has the most flight delays, so there's a good chance our flight will be delayed this month too. While in September, according to statistics, the least flight delays occur. Therefore, if you are planning a trip by plane, then the best month for your plans to best match your expectations is September._

```{python}
#| label: Q3
#| code-summary: Clear month data
# clear data
clearData = df
clearData.replace('', np.nan, inplace=True)
clearData.replace('n/a', np.nan, inplace=True)
clearData.replace('Febuary', 'February', inplace=True)
# Delete all rows with no named month
data3 = clearData.query("@pd.notnull(month)")
# Group rows by the 'month'
data3 = data3.groupby('month').agg(
    total_num_of_flights = ('num_of_flights_total', 'sum'),
    total_num_of_delays = ('num_of_delays_total', 'sum')
).reset_index()
# Add the 'proportion of delayed flights in %' column
data3 = data3.assign(proportion_of_delayed_flights = lambda x: round(x.total_num_of_delays/x.total_num_of_flights, 2)*100)
# Sort table by the 'months'
month_dict = {'January':1,'February':2,'March':3, 'April':4, 'May':5, 'June':6, 'July':7, 'August':8, 'September':9, 'October':10, 'November':11, 'December':12}
data3 = data3.sort_values(['month'], key = lambda x : x.apply (lambda x : month_dict[x]), ascending=True).reset_index(drop=True)
```

```{python}
#| label: Q3-chart
#| code-summary: Create chart which show rate of delayed flights for each month
#| fig-cap: "Rate of delayed flights for each month"
#| fig-align: center
# best (min) and worst (max) months index
min_index = min(range(len(data3['proportion_of_delayed_flights'])), key=lambda i: data3['proportion_of_delayed_flights'][i])
max_index = max(range(len(data3['proportion_of_delayed_flights'])), key=lambda i: data3['proportion_of_delayed_flights'][i])
# Define colors list with default color for all bars
colors = ['#636efa'] * len(data3['proportion_of_delayed_flights'])
# Recolor the bar with minimum value
colors[min_index] = 'green'
colors[max_index] = 'red'
chart3 = px.bar(data3,
    x="month", 
    y="proportion_of_delayed_flights"
)
chart3.data[0].marker.color = colors
chart3.update_layout(
    xaxis_title = "Month",
    yaxis_title = "Rate of delayed flights in %"
)
# Rotate text under the bar like the Yaxis title
chart3.update_xaxes(tickangle=270)
chart3.show()
```

## Q4: Calculation of Total Weather-Related Flight Delays

__Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild).__
According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:

a. 100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather
b. 30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather
c. From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%

_While studying the data necessary for the calculations, it was discovered that flights delayed due to a late plane had incorrect data in the form of -999, which I corrected to the average value for this column. The remaining columns required for calculations had data correct for calculations._

```{python}
#| label: Q4
#| code-summary: Clear data and calculate total number of delays by weather
# Use mean value for missing data
mean_late_aircraft = clearData.num_of_delays_late_aircraft.mean()
clearData.replace(-999, mean_late_aircraft, inplace=True)
# calculate delays by weather
predata = clearData.assign(delays_by_weather_months = lambda x: 0.4*x.num_of_delays_nas if str(x.month) in ['April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August'] else 0.65*x.num_of_delays_nas)
predata = predata.assign(delays_by_weather = lambda x: x.num_of_delays_weather + 0.3*x.num_of_delays_late_aircraft + x.delays_by_weather_months)

# Columns to include in the resut table
columns_to_include = ['airport_code', 'airport_name', 'month', 'num_of_flights_total', 'num_of_delays_total', 'num_of_delays_weather', 'num_of_delays_late_aircraft', 'num_of_delays_nas', 'delays_by_weather']
# Filter DataFrame to include only desired columns
data4 = predata[columns_to_include]
```

```{python}
#| label: Q4table
#| code-summary: Table with total number of delays by weather
#| tbl-cap: "Top 5 rows with total number of delays by weather"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
table4 = data4.head(5)

display(table4)

```

## Q5: Analysis of Weather-Related Flight Delays by Airport

__Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Describe what you learn from this graph.__

_According to statistics and taking into account all data errors on the histogram, we can see the following: Siberian Federal District, ORD, ATL have approximately the same high percentage of flights delayed due to weather - 40+%. This means that when choosing these airports, you should pay attention to the expected weather when flying in that region. SAN Airport has the lowest percentage of flights delayed due to weather - 30%._

```{python}
#| label: Q5
#| code-summary: Prepare data for proportion of delays by weather for each airport
data5 = predata.groupby("airport_code").agg(
    total_num_of_delays = ('num_of_delays_total', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_weather = ('num_of_delays_weather', 'sum'),
    numu_of_delays_late_aircraft = ('num_of_delays_late_aircraft', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_nas = ('num_of_delays_nas', 'sum'),
    total_num_of_delays_by_weather = ('delays_by_weather', 'sum')
).reset_index()
# Add the 'proportion of delayed flights by weather' column
data5 = data5.assign(proportion_of_delayed_flights_by_weather = lambda x: round(x.total_num_of_delays_by_weather/x.total_num_of_delays, 2)*100)
```

```{python}
#| label: Q5-chart
#| code-summary: Chart for showing the rate of delayed flights by weather for each airport
#| fig-cap: "Rate of delayed flights by weather for each airport"
#| fig-align: center
chart5 = px.bar(data5.head(200),
    x="airport_code", 
    y="proportion_of_delayed_flights_by_weather"
)

chart5.update_layout(
    xaxis_title = "Airport code",
    yaxis_title = "Rate of delayed flights by weather in %"
)
chart5.show()
```

## Q6: Comparative Analysis of Flight Delay Types

__Which delay is the worst delay?__
 Create a similar analysis as above for Weahter Delay with: Carrier Delay and Security Delay. Compare the proportion of delay for each of the three categories in a Chart and a Table. Describe your results.

_When examining the data needed for the calculations, it was discovered that the required columns had incorrect data, which I corrected to the average of that column. According to statistics and taking into account all the data errors on the histogram, we see the following: the largest number of delays is associated with weather - 39%, the smallest number of delays is associated with security - almost 0%._

```{python}
#| label: Q6
#| code-summary: Clear data before grouping
# Clear num_of_delays_carrier
predata['Numeric_Column'] = pd.to_numeric(predata['num_of_delays_carrier'], errors='coerce')
mean_value = predata['Numeric_Column'].mean()
predata['num_of_delays_carrier'] = predata['Numeric_Column'].fillna(mean_value)
# Clear num_of_delays_security
predata['Numeric_Column'] = pd.to_numeric(predata['num_of_delays_security'], errors='coerce')
mean_value = predata['Numeric_Column'].mean()
predata['num_of_delays_security'] = predata['Numeric_Column'].fillna(mean_value)
```

```{python}
#| label: Q6table
#| code-summary: Prepare data for table and chart
#| tbl-cap: "Rate of delayed flights by weather, carrier and security"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
predata['Numeric_Column'] = 1
data6 = predata.groupby("Numeric_Column").agg(
    total_num_of_delays = ('num_of_delays_total', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_weather = ('num_of_delays_weather', 'sum'),
    numu_of_delays_late_aircraft = ('num_of_delays_late_aircraft', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_nas = ('num_of_delays_nas', 'sum'),
    total_num_of_delays_by_weather = ('delays_by_weather', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_carrier = ('num_of_delays_carrier', 'sum'),
    num_of_delays_security = ('num_of_delays_security', 'sum')
).reset_index()
# Add the 'proportion of delayed flights by weather' column
data6 = data6.assign(rate_of_delayed_flights_by_weather = lambda x: round(x.total_num_of_delays_by_weather/x.total_num_of_delays, 2)*100)
data6 = data6.assign(rate_of_delayed_flights_by_carrier = lambda x: round(x.num_of_delays_carrier/x.total_num_of_delays, 2)*100)
data6 = data6.assign(rate_of_delayed_flights_by_security = lambda x: round(x.num_of_delays_security/x.total_num_of_delays, 2)*100)
# Columns to include in the resut table
columns_to_include = ['rate_of_delayed_flights_by_weather', 'rate_of_delayed_flights_by_carrier', 'rate_of_delayed_flights_by_security']
# Filter DataFrame to include only desired columns
data6 = data6[columns_to_include]
data6
```

```{python}
#| label: Q6-chart
#| code-summary: Code for creating chart
#| fig-cap: "Rate of delayed flights by weather, carrier and security"
#| fig-align: center
# Extract column names and values
import plotly.graph_objects as go
column_names = data6.columns
values = data6.values.flatten()
chart6 = go.Figure(data=[go.Bar(x=column_names, y=values, marker_color=['blue', 'orange', 'green'])])

chart6.update_layout(
    xaxis_title = "Type of delays",
    yaxis_title = "Rate of delayed flights in %"
)
