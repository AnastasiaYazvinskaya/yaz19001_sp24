    "text": "Core question 3\nMary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names.\nPrior to 1970, the most popular name was Mary. It was given to their children 2-4 times more often than the name Paul, which is in second place. An interesting point is that from 1970 to 2000 the use of the names Mary and Paul is almost the same. Martha and Peter are quite rare names for those years from 19021 to 2000. However, it is interesting to note that initially the name Martha was preferable, but after 1950 the situation changed, so that the name Peter became more popular. By 2000, the general usage of all four names was nearly the same.\n\n\nCode which finds all data for Mary, Martha, Peter and Paul names between 1920-2000 years\ndata_3 = df.query('(name == \"Mary\" | name == \"Martha\" | name == \"Peter\" | name == \"Paul\") & year &gt;=1920 & year &lt;=2000')\n\n\n\n\nCode for creating chart\nchart_3 =px.line(data_3,\n  x=\"year\",\n  y=\"Total\",\n  color='name'\n)\nchart_3.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Year\",\n    yaxis_title = \"People born with the names Mary, Martha, Peter and Paul\"\n)\nchart_3.show()\n\n\n                                                \nHistory of use of the names Mary, Martha, Peter and Paul",
